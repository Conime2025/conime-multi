### Minor Notes

- **Overly Theatrical Villains**
  Characters like Kanryū Takeda and Jin-e can feel a bit over-the-top with their dramatic acting and delivery.

- **Thin Supporting Characters**
  Due to runtime constraints, supporting characters like Megumi and Sanosuke have less background than their manga/anime versions.
