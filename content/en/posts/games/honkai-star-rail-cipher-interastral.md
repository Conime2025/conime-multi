HoYoverse has released a special Interastral Peace Entertainment program titled:

### “Approaching Star Rail — Cipher: Getting Rich in Every Direction!”

This special episode introduces Cipher and his unexpected rival, the so-called "Phantom Thief" Bartholos, in a satirical variety-show format packed with Honkai’s signature humor. Bartholos even brags about his “water-drop-shaped head” giving him an aerodynamic advantage—while Cipher can only admit defeat in this hilarious “aerodynamic competition.”

### Episode Overview

The episode delivers lighthearted, satirical comedy as Bartholos taunts Cipher with an imaginary scorecard awarding himself 1 point for aerodynamics and Cipher 0. The whole sketch is played out in classic variety-show style, mixing silly banter with subtle lore, making it a fun watch for players.

More than just a gag, it’s HoYoverse’s creative way to introduce Cipher to the Honkai: Star Rail universe in a fresh, entertaining manner.

### English Voice Cast (CV)
