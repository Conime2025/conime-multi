CyberAgent and Shochiku have officially announced an anime adaptation of *Kagurabachi*, the hit action manga by Takeru Hokazono. The news immediately generated hype among fans eager for a bloody, magic-fueled revenge story in modern shonen style.

### Production Details
The anime will be produced by **CygamesPictures**, the studio behind *The Summer Hikaru Died* for Netflix. According to CBR, choosing CygamesPictures over big-name studios like MAPPA or Bones is a strategic move to ensure a more stable production schedule.

This approach reflects a broader industry trend toward decentralizing production, aiming to avoid overworked staff and delays that have plagued recent high-profile projects.

### Manga Popularity
Since its debut in **Weekly Shonen Jump**, *Kagurabachi* has sold over **1.3 million copies** and logged **99 million views** on MANGA Plus. Its story of bloody revenge, dark sorcery, and legendary swords has captured readers’ imaginations worldwide.
