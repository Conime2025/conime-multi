### I Was Hesitant at First—Now I Regret Not Watching Sooner
At first, I saw Belle's visuals and wasn't interested. They looked strange to me, and I didn't feel drawn in. But after seeing it pop up in so many recommendations and reading so many positive comments, I finally watched it… and instantly regretted waiting so long!

This film is incredibly moving. When Belle begins singing, I got chills. The music, voice, graphics, and lyrics blend perfectly. The emotion is so real. I nearly cried because Belle’s song felt like it was voicing her very soul.

I also realized I'd been familiar with her songs thanks to listening to Hana Hope's covers—even before seeing the film, I already liked the music.



### Its Greatest Strength: Stunning Music
The soundtrack is exceptional. Kaho Nakamura's vocals as Belle are both powerful and gentle. Songs like *U*, *Lend Me Your Voice*, and *A Million Miles Away* convey unspoken feelings with raw honesty.

If you've ever heard a Belle song cover on YouTube, you probably fell in love with the music even before knowing the film.



### An Emotional Story with Strong Supporting Characters
The story isn’t just about the virtual world, but about inner wounds and the courage to speak the truth. After her mother’s death, Suzu becomes withdrawn and loses her spark. But thanks to her friends—especially Hiro and the others—she begins to recover. Their warmth and genuine care come through so clearly.

One pleasant surprise is Lilas Ikuta (Rira Ikuta), the famous YOASOBI singer, who voices Hiroka. Even though she doesn’t sing in the film, her voice acting feels incredibly natural and alive.

### About Love: Who Does Suzu Like?
Honestly, the romantic aspect of the film is a little confusing. Does Suzu like Ryuu (Kei) romantically? Isn’t he just a kid? Or does she have feelings for Shinobu, her childhood friend who’s always watching over her?

In my view, Suzu and Kei share more of an emotional connection, helping each other heal. Meanwhile, with Shinobu, it feels more like childhood friendship and mutual care, not necessarily romantic love.



### Spectacular Visuals and a Vibrant Virtual World
The virtual world *U* is depicted spectacularly. It's colorful, creative, and surprisingly deep. The contrast between Suzu’s simple real-world life and the fantastical world of U makes her journey feel even more dramatic and meaningful.



### Viewer Comments
> “The visuals and music are amazing. I cried when Belle sang. Truly one of Mamoru Hosoda’s best films.” — MyAnimeList user 'X‑'*

> “I rated it 8 stars, but it feels like 9. Because Mamoru Hosoda really understands the human soul like few people can.” — IMDb user 'J‑'*



### Author's Note
I didn’t expect this film to leave such an impression. *Belle* isn’t just about technology or virtual worlds—it’s about the voice we hide, the wounds we carry, and the power to heal. If my own life were ever made into a film, I’d want its music to be this good.
