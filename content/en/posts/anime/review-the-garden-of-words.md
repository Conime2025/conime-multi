### A Slow but Moving Story

Takao Akizuki is a 15-year-old high school student who dreams of becoming a shoemaker. He often spends rainy mornings at Shinjuku Gyoen Park, skipping class to design shoes. In that quiet park, he meets Yukari Yukino—a mysterious, fragile yet graceful older woman, quietly sipping beer and eating chocolate while lost in thought.

Takao and Yukari don't immediately connect. Their conversations are sparse, their meetings end in silence, and they continue to encounter each other by chance. Over time, the rainy park becomes their sanctuary—a place where two lost souls can heal each other without needing to define what they are.

Through the classic tanka poetry she shares, Takao slowly realizes Yukari is no ordinary woman. She’s actually his school’s classical literature teacher who disappeared under the weight of student rumors and personal pressure. Their shared silence becomes an unspoken form of communication—real and soothing.

### Shinkai's Most Beautiful Visuals?

The visual detail in *The Garden of Words* is simply stunning. From the raindrops and wet leaves to shimmering water reflections—it’s all drawn with the precision of a living painting. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call this Shinkai’s most visually beautiful film.

### Music and Voice That Bind Emotions

The soundtrack by Daisuke Kashiwa flows gently, perfectly matching the film’s quiet mood. The theme song “Rain” by Motohiro Hata is especially moving. And of course, Kana Hanazawa’s voice as Yukari adds a layer of emotion—calm yet fragile.



### Symbolism and an Open Ending

One of *The Garden of Words*’ strengths is its subtle yet strong use of metaphor. For example, Yukari’s habit of touching her foot, at first seeming like a physical injury, is actually a sign of her inability to “move forward” in life. She’s lost her footing as a teacher and a person. Meanwhile, Takao’s skill and dream of making shoes symbolize his desire to help her “walk again.”

As the film nears its end, their relationship faces unavoidable reality. There’s no grand declaration of love, but there is an emotional outpouring that can’t be held back. A rainy, stormy afternoon becomes the most honest moment of their lives. But like the rain that comes and goes, their meeting also must end.

Yet their story doesn’t feel truly finished. There are shoes left unworn, silent promises yet to be fulfilled. The film closes simply but leaves room for hope—enough to make us wonder, *“Will they meet again?”*



### Author's Note

This film is only 46 minutes long, so it doesn’t dig deeply into every character’s background. But that brevity makes it feel like a compact visual poem—quiet, yet lingering.

For viewers who prefer big conflicts and heavy dialogue, *The Garden of Words* might feel too slow. But to me, its silence and measured pace are what make it special—giving us space to reflect, sink into the rainy mood, and feel close to the characters’ quiet loneliness.

Personally, I also really love Kana Hanazawa’s voice. Whenever she appears in anime—especially as the main character—I always fall for it. Here, her soft and fragile delivery suits the rainy, quiet atmosphere perfectly. It’s like a gentle whisper that calms you but goes straight to the heart.
