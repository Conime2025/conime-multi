The *Gachiakuta* anime has officially announced its broadcast debut for **July 6, 2025** at 23:30 JST on CBC/TBS in Japan. Alongside the release date, the official site revealed the main promotional video, new teaser visual, theme song details, and plans for global premiere screenings in 15 countries under the ambitious *Gachiakuta World Takeover* campaign.

Adapted from Kei Urana’s gritty manga, *Gachiakuta* promises a dark shonen action story with sharp social commentary about a world that discards people as easily as trash. The “World Takeover” initiative highlights the production’s global ambitions, aiming to connect with fans around the world right from launch.

### Official Theme Songs

The anime will feature two specially written theme songs:
- **Opening (OP)**: "HUGs" by **Paledusk**
- **Ending (ED)**: "灯火 (Tomoshibi)" by **DUSTCELL**

Paledusk describes their lyrics as some of their most emotional work to date, while DUSTCELL explains that *Tomoshibi* expresses the struggle against injustice and the search for true meaning in life.

### New Characters & Voice Cast

- **Regto** (Rudo's foster father): Toshiyuki Morikawa
- **Jabber** (member of the "Arashiya" organization): Yūki Shin

Both voice actors shared their enthusiasm for these roles, emphasizing the emotional depth and complexity of the characters they portray.
